Embedded System Monitoring Project (SysMon Embedded)

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive embedded system that not only monitors system health and performance but also provides real-time data visualization and alerting capabilities. This system will be implemented on an embedded board, such as the PandaBoard, leveraging a kernel module for data collection and a web interface for visualization.

System Components:
Kernel Module: A custom kernel module will be developed to collect crucial system information such as CPU usage, memory utilization, system temperature, and other performance metrics. This data will be exposed via a file in the /proc directory, allowing easy access for other applications.

Web Application: A PHP-based web application will serve as the user interface. The application will query the kernel module, retrieve the system data, and display it in a user-friendly, real-time dashboard. Data will be presented in a key-value format for easy parsing and understanding.

Alert System: When any of the system metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU temperature reaching critical levels), the kernel module will send an alert through a netlink socket. These alerts will be captured by a client application and displayed in the web interface, providing users with immediate notification of potential issues.

Embedded Hardware: The system will be developed for an embedded platform such as the PandaBoard, which will run the Linux OS. This platform will provide a foundation for the kernel module and PHP web application to interact, ensuring the monitoring system is capable of running on low-power embedded hardware.

Objectives:
Build a fully functioning system monitoring tool for embedded Linux platforms.
Develop a kernel module for data collection and real-time processing.
Create an easy-to-use web interface that fetches and displays system data.
Implement an alert system to notify users of critical system performance issues.
Demonstrate the applicationâ€™s functionality on an embedded board like the PandaBoard.
